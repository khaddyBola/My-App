    <h2>About Me 😍</h2>
    <h1>Hey there, I'm Khady Bola, learn to code with me 😎</h1>
    <p>I am completely self-taught, with a lot left to learn and in teaching myself tech skills,<br>
        I uncovered a passion for teaching others. Today, <br>
        I’m driven by the goal of making education affordable and accessible to <all class="br"></all>
        Since I began gaining valuable digital skills, <br>
        I’ve been able to make more money, pursue passions that I care about, <br>
        and, ultimately, enjoy freedom and flexibility. <br>
